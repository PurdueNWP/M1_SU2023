In this class, we use the GitHub to store weekly computing project files for users to download to Anvil to work with. One advantage of using the GitHub is that the course instructors can update the course files efficiently while keeping track of the changes. Students will keep a copy of the course GitHub repository in their Anvil account, and will be asked to update this copy weekly throughout the course.

## 1. How to *clone* this GitHub repository to Anvil

The process of copying all of the files in a GitHub repository to a user's computer, in our case the Anvil supercomputer, is called *cloning*. Specifically, you will have all of the files in the course GitHub repository copied into the *home* directory of your Anvil account. This provides tremendous convenience for your computing projects. The instructors will coutinuously update the GitHub contents, and will ask you to *reset* the copy in your Anvil *home* directory to the newest contents every week.

To facilitate a secure way for Anvil users to clone from or reset to the course GitHub, a set of *SSH Keys* must be created in Anvil.

### a. Generate a pair of *SSH Keys*

 - [![Github Cloning Part a SSH Key Generation ](http://img.youtube.com/vi/RXtFeUIr-NI /0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXtFeUIr-NI  "Github Cloning a SSH Key Generation")
 -  SSH keys provide an authentication mechanism, a secure way, for Anvil users to access the GitHub securely without the need to transmit passwords over the network.  
 - We will take the steps following this [GitHub instruction](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key) to generate a matching pair of private and public keys in Anvil.
   -  Log into Anvil OnDemand: https://ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu/
   -  Select **Clusters** then **\>\_Anvil Shell Access**
   -  Type the following behind the command prompt:
`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@purdue.edu"`. In this command, `ed25519` is the algorithm used to generate the SSH keys; `your_email@purdue.edu` is the email you signed up to the GitHub account with. If you do not yet have a GitHub account, please check out the instruction in the course Brightspace to create one first.
      - Enter a file in which to save the key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519: [Press enter]`); by pressing enter you accept the default file name `id_ed25519`.
      - Enter a passphrase and remember this passphrase.


### b. Adding the public *SSH Key* to your GitHub account

 - - [![Github Cloning Part b Adding Pub Key to Github ](http://img.youtube.com/vi/TnicoRO8hSI /0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnicoRO8hSI  "Github Cloning b Adding Pub Key to Github")
 - In the previous step a., a pair of *SSH Keys* were generated,`id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519.pub`, and stored in `~/.ssh`. To see them, type `ls ~/.ssh`.
 - We will essentially follow this [GitHub instruction](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account#adding-a-new-s[â€¦]to-your-account) so that a copy of `id_ed25519.pub` will be saved in your GitHub account setting.
     - For step 1, in **\>\_Anvil Shell Access**, type the following behind the command prompt: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`. Then, copy the entire line output on the screen, follow through the rest of the steps in the instruction.
     - Once completed, make sure you exit the **\>\_Anvil Shell Access** by typing:`exit`. Then, close the browser tab of the **\>\_Anvil Shell Access** to protect your SSH Key.

### c. To clone the GitHub for the first time

 -  [![Github Cloning Part c Cloning Github First time ](http://img.youtube.com/vi/OmdG-caUVkU /0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmdG-caUVkU  "Github Cloning c Cloning Github Firsttime")
 -  Make sure you are logged into Anvil OnDemand: https://ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu/
 -  Select **Clusters** then **\>\_Anvil Shell Access**
 -  Type the following behind the command prompt:

```
cd

git clone git@github.com:PurdueNWP/M1_SP2023.git
```

 -  These will make sure that your copy of the GitHub repository will be in your home directory as
```
~/M1_SP2023
```

### d. To checkout updated repository in future weeks

 - Make sure you are in the your cloned GitHub directory:
```
cd ~/M1_SP2023/
```
 - Checkout the current master branch:
```
git checkout master
```
 - *The branching step is optional*. The purpose is to preserve your changes in your local files, if any, up to this point. You could customize the branch name.
```
git branch mybranch-date
```
However, we recommend the simple practice of copying codes you need from `~/M1_SP2023` to `~/NWP1` (to be set up for you in the next step). Then, make changes in `~/NWP1` for your exercise and reports. That way, you compeltely avoid the need for branching.

 - The following steps will reset your files in `~/M1_SP2023` to those at the **origin** at https://github.com/PurdueNWP/M1_SP2023

```
git fetch --all
```
You will be asked to provide your career account and password.

```
git reset --hard origin/master
```

## 2. Setup your Python and Quarto environments for the course

The script [`first_launch.sh`](first_launch.sh) automates three tasks. The end of the video above also shows how to run this script.

 - Install [Quarto](https://quarto.org) in your Anvil home directory, the newest scientific and technical publishing system that you will generate your project reports with. 
 - Create a directory `~/NWP1` with sub-directories by the week for you to store and develop your work with.
 - Install a Jupyter Notebook "kernel" that will load the **MetPy** Python environment built for this course.
 
To run the script, use the following two steps. 

### a. Make the script executable
The first step is to make the file executable by changing its attributes:

```
cd ~/M1_SP2023/Week1
chmod +x first_launch.sh
```

### b. Execute the script

```
./first_launch.sh
```

There will be a short run of screen output, followed by the messages:

```
Quarto CLI installed successfully!
To Use the Python MetPy environment in the future, type the following commands:
module use /anvil/projects/x-ees230003/etc/modules
module load conda-env/MetPy-py3.8.8
Or, select Python (My MetPy Kernel) in the Jupyter Notebook
```
