        "\n",
        "In this assignment, you will run your first WRF simulation. Use this Quarto document to place your figures and answer questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, you will learn to perform the following tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        " - To navigate Anvil's file system using commands (known as *common shell commands*) such as `cd` and `ls`, then copy files with `cp` in a terminal.\n",
        " - To submit a script (known as *shell script*) that prompts the WRF simulation to run and outputs figures of variables from the simulation.\n",
        " - Using the plotted variables from your WRF simulation to compare with those from an altered WRF simulation (CAM Phyics WRF, already provided to you) and the NARR plot from Week 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "To run the WRF model and collect output figures, please follow these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        " -  Make sure you are logged into [Anvil OnDemand](https://ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu/):\n",
        " -  Then, start an instance of Desktop at [Anvil OnDemand](https://ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu/) by selecting **Interactive Apps** then **Desktop**.\n",
        "     -  Select **ees230003** under Allocation\n",
        "     -  Select **wholenode** under Queue \n",
        "     -  Use **1** under Wall Time in Hours\n",
        "     -  Use **128** under Cores\n",
        "     -  Launch and wait in the Queue\n",
        "     -  Before Launching the Desktop, choose higher quality image than default if you are on fast internet, such as on campus with strong WiFi signals.\n",
        " -  Right Click on the Desktop then choose \"Open Terminal Here\" to start a terminal.\n",
        " -  In the command line, change to your `/scratch` directory by typing and entering in the terminal: \n",
        "```\n",
        "cd /anvil/scratch/x-[yourusername]/\n",
        "```\n",
        "Swap `[yourusername]` with your Anvil account name. The `/scratch` directory has ample space, up to 100 terabytes (TB) per person, to hold large amount of data. Your personal home directory could only hold 25 Gigabytes (GB). Therefore, it is imperative to use `/scratch` for computing workflows that generate a large amount of data, such as a WRF model simulation.\n",
        "\n",
        " -  Confirm that you are indeed in your `/scratch/x-[yourusername]` space by typing and entering:\n",
        "```\n",
        "pwd\n",
        "```\n",
        "You should see `/anvil/scratch/x-[yourusername]` in the returned output. If not, check and repeat the previous step.\n",
        "\n",
        " -  Copy the *container* of the WRF model setup for the Jan 2016 Blizzard into your `/scratch/x-[yourusername]` space by typing and entering: \n",
        "```\n",
        "cp /anvil/projects/nwp/depot/DATA/Week2/Week2.tar.gz /anvil/scratch/x-[yourusername]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        " -  The *container* is saved in a *tarball*. To unpack it, type and enter:\n",
        "```\n",
        "tar -zxvf Week2.tar.gz\n",
        "```\n",
        "Wait for several minutes for all directories and files to unpack from the tarball.\n",
        "\n",
        " -  After the model *container* is reconstructed in your `/scratch/x-[yourusername]`, change directories again, by typing and entering: \n",
        "```\n",
        " cd Week2/home/ec2-user/\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        " -  Now you are in the directory `/scratch/x-[yourusername]/Week2/home/ec2-user/`. List its contents using the linux command `ls`:\n",
        "```\n",
        "ls\n",
        "```\n",
        "You should see 9 items listed alphabetically:\n",
        "```\n",
        "container-dtc-nwp  data  gsi_4.1.0.sif  nwp-container-met_4.1.0.sif  python_4.1.0.sif  Runwrf.sh  snow  upp_4.1.0.sif  wps_wrf_4.1.0_for_singularity.sif\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        " -  Start the WRF simulation by typing and entering the name of the running script: \n",
        "```\n",
        "./Runwrf.sh\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        " -  DO NOT CLOSE OUT YOUR WINDOW UNTIL YOU SEE THE MODEL HAS FINISHED RUNNING. This should take about 25 minutes.  The Python code will also post-process your WRF output and create PNG images for us to use. At the end of the run, you will see a message similar to the following two lines:\n",

        "```\n",

        "cd snow/pythonprd/\n",
        "```\n",
        "For your information, the *absolute path* of the directory is now `/anvil/scratch/x-[yourusername]/Week2/home/ec2-user/snow/pythonprd/`.\n",
