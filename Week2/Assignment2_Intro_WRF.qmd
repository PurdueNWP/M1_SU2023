# Assignment 2: Introduction to WRF-ARW

## 1. Introduction:

In this assignment, you will run your first WRF simulation. Use this Quarto document to place your figures and answer questions.

Moreover, you will learn to perform the following tasks:

 - To navigate Anvil's file system using commands (known as *common shell commands*) such as `cd` and `ls`, then copy files with `cp` in a terminal.
 - To submit a script (known as *shell script*) that prompts the WRF simulation to run and outputs figures of variables from the simulation.
 - Using the plotted variables from your WRF simulation to compare with those from an altered WRF simulation (CAM Phyics WRF, already provided to you) and the NARR plot from Week 1.

To run the WRF model and collect output figures, please follow these steps:

 -  Make sure you are logged into [Anvil OnDemand](https://ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu/):
 -  Then, start an instance of Desktop at [Anvil OnDemand](https://ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu/) by selecting **Interactive Apps** then **Desktop**.
     -  Select **ees230003** under Allocation
     -  Select **wholenode** under Queue 
     -  Use **1** under Wall Time in Hours
     -  Use **128** under Cores
     -  Launch and wait in the Queue
     -  Before Launching the Desktop, choose higher quality image than default if you are on fast internet, such as on campus with strong WiFi signals.
 -  Right Click on the Desktop then choose "Open Terminal Here" to start a terminal.
 -  In the command line, change to your `/scratch` directory by typing and entering in the terminal: 
```
cd /anvil/scratch/x-[yourusername]/
```
Swap `[yourusername]` with your Anvil account name. The `/scratch` directory has ample space, up to 100 terabytes (TB) per person, to hold large amount of data. Your personal home directory could only hold 25 Gigabytes (GB). Therefore, it is imperative to use `/scratch` for computing workflows that generate a large amount of data, such as a WRF model simulation.

 -  Confirm that you are indeed in your `/scratch/x-[yourusername]` space by typing and entering:
```
pwd
```
You should see `/anvil/scratch/x-[yourusername]` in the returned output. If not, check and repeat the previous step.

 -  Copy the *container* of the WRF model setup for the Jan 2016 Blizzard into your `/scratch/x-[yourusername]` space by typing and entering: 
```
cp /anvil/projects/nwp/depot/DATA/Week2/Week2.tar.gz /anvil/scratch/x-[yourusername]
```

 -  The *container* is saved in a *tarball*. To unpack it, type and enter:
```
tar -zxvf Week2.tar.gz
```
Wait for several minutes for all directories and files to unpack from the tarball.

 -  After the model *container* is reconstructed in your `/scratch/x-[yourusername]`, change directories again, by typing and entering: 
```
 cd Week2/home/ec2-user/
```

 -  Now you are in the directory `/scratch/x-[yourusername]/Week2/home/ec2-user/`. List its contents using the linux command `ls`:
```
ls
```
You should see 10 items listed alphabetically:
```
container-dtc-nwp  data  F12CAMPHYS  gsi_4.1.0.sif  nwp-container-met_4.1.0.sif  python_4.1.0.sif  Runwrf.sh  snow  upp_4.1.0.sif  wps_wrf_4.1.0_for_singularity.sif
```

 -  Start the WRF simulation by typing and entering the name of the running script: 
```
./Runwrf.sh
```

 -  DO NOT CLOSE OUT YOUR WINDOW UNTIL YOU SEE THE MODEL HAS FINISHED RUNNING. This should take about 25 minutes.  The Python code will also post-process your WRF output and create PNG images for us to use. At the end of the run, you will see a message similar to the following two lines:
```
### Finished the run: Sat Apr  1 01:01:01 EDT 2023
### Elapsed:          1651 sec.
```

 -  Once your model has finished running, change the directory into: 
```
cd snow/pythonprd/
```
For your information, the *absolute path* of the directory is now `/anvil/scratch/x-[yourusername]/Week2/home/ec2-user/snow/pythonprd/`.

 -  Acquire a copy of the file `2mT_d01_f12.png` and save it to your Week2 report working directory by the command: 
```
cp 2mT_d01_f12.png ~/NWP1/Week2/
```

 -  Similarly, acquire a copy of the file `2mdew_d01_f12.png` by the command: 
```
cp 2mdew_d01_f12.png ~/NWP1/Week2/
```
 
 -  A copy of the CAM Physics WRF output `CAM2mT_f12.png` figure is saved as `/anvil/projects/nwp/depot/DATA/Week2/CAM2mT_f12.png`, copy it into your working directory `~/NWP1/Week2/` (how?)
  
 -  A copy of the NARR surface temperature figure produced in the assignment in Week 1 is saved as `/anvil/projects/nwp/depot/DATA/Week2/NARR_Sfc_Temp_12UTC012316.png`. Copy it into your working directory `~/NWP1/Week2/` (how?)
 
 -  Place the figures under Question 2.


```

## 2. Report:

Please answer the following questions to complete your report. To preview the document in progress, click on the *Render* button above the document. A HTML (web) file will be created for you to view.

### Question 1

In RStudio, select *File* on the upper left corner of the menu bar. Then, choose *Open File*. In the dialog window, type in the blank space behind *File name* `/anvil/scratch/[x-yourusername/Week2/home/ec2-user/snow/wrfprd/namelist.input` to open the file `namelist.input`. This is the configuration file used by the WRF model to set various parameters and options for your simulation, including the domain size, time steps, initial conditions, boundary conditions, physics options, and other settings. Please examine this file and answer:

a) What is the start date and time of this simulation?  

b) What is the x-y domain of this simulation?

c) What is the radiation parameterization schemed used in this simulation?  Describe what this radiation scheme does/how it calculates radiation.

### Question 2

Figure comparisons: 

To post and caption a figure, for example the NARR surface temperature plot, use this syntax:

![NARR Surface Temperature at 12Z Jan 23 2016](~/NWP1/Week2/NARR_Sfc_Temp_12UTC012316.png)

(a) Compare the 2m temperature from your WRF simulation output at 12Z with the CAM radiation WRF 2m temperature at 12Z. What, if any differences do you notice in the temperature distribution?  

(b) Now compare your WRF 12Z 2m temperature to the NARR observations plotted in Week 1.  How did your simulation perform qualitatively?  

(c) Now compare the CAM radiation WRF 12Z 2m Temperature with NARR observations.  How did this simulation perform with temperature compare to observations?  

(d) Do you think your RRTMG simulation did better or worst than the CAM simulation compared with the observations?
