    "text": "In this assignment, we will work on a Quarto document in RStudio to execute Python commands. Sounds intriguing? RStudio is a very good multilingual IDE (Integrated development environment). And, Quarto is an open-source document processing platform that allows users to create documents in various formats, including PDF, HTML, and Microsoft Word, using four languages: Python, R, Julia, and Observable.\nThe goal is to visualize the surface temperature of the Jan 2016 Blizzard. Then, we will render this Quarto file to generate a polished report. A Quarto (qmd) file is available in ~/M1_SU2023/Week1, named Assignment1_Getting_Started.qmd.\nPlease follow this video to complete the exercise and upload your report in Word document to the Brightspace. (Important: Say No when asked if you want to install miniconda.)"
